# Agent Operating Guide

Agents working in this repository must treat the repository itself as the workspace and
the monorepo foundation as the product being implemented. There is no mandatory
`<project>` path segment: workspace units live under physical roots such as `apps/web`
and `servers/api`. These are defaults, not directories to create without a real need.

Before changing code:

1. Read this file and `architecture.yaml`.
2. Inspect the relevant workspace unit through the repository control plane.
3. Keep dependencies explicit and boundaries clear.
4. Prefer functional modules, pure functions, immutable data, and explicit dependency passing.
5. Run the smallest useful validation command after changes.

Read the narrowest authoritative guide for the work:

- `.agent/instructions/architecture.md` for planes, feature ownership, and dependency direction.
- `.agent/instructions/ui-composition.md` for shadcn, Tailwind, component hierarchy, and page composition.
- `.agent/instructions/integrations.md` for external systems and reusable infrastructure.
- `.agent/standards/types-validation.md` for local versus shared contracts and runtime schemas.
- `.agent/standards/testing.md` for unit, component, integration, and end-to-end test intent.
- `.agent/standards/development.md` for functional implementation and progressive growth.

Classify the scope before editing: application, reusable package, infrastructure/enabler,
project knowledge, foundation, or control plane. Application work does not authorize
foundation or control-plane changes.

Implementation follows `UNDERSTAND -> PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> VALIDATE -> REVIEW -> RECORD -> COMPLETE`.
Create feature-owned code first, add layers only when a concrete boundary requires them,
and extract packages only after ownership and genuine cross-boundary reuse are established.
The governing principle is: everything available, nothing unnecessarily imposed.

Architecture is feature-first. Server features are flat by default, using optional files
such as `<feature>.route.ts`, `<feature>.controller.ts`, `<feature>.service.ts`,
`<feature>.repository.ts`, `<feature>.validation.ts`, `<feature>.model.ts`, and
`<feature>.integration.ts`. Introduce `domain/` only for meaningful domain complexity.
Do not create role folders or any other architectural directory merely to represent a pattern.

The control plane lives in `codebase/`. It must not use Turborepo, Nx, Lerna, or another third-party monorepo orchestrator as its foundation.
`architecture.yaml` uses the JSON-compatible subset of YAML so Node.js can load the
authoritative policy without adding a parser dependency to the control plane.

Workspace-unit code under `apps/`, `servers/`, `packages/`, and `prebuilt/` may use appropriate external libraries. The control plane should stay dependency-light and prefer Node.js built-ins plus repository-owned code. `packages/` owns reusable pieces; `prebuilt/` owns assembled reusable solutions; `enablers/` owns operational support.

Useful commands:

```text
npm run projects
npm run graph
npm run tasks
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run check
npm run scan
npm test
```

Workspace-unit tasks run through `node codebase/cli/repo.mjs run <task>`. Use `--dry-run` to
inspect ordering and `--json` when another tool needs stable output.
